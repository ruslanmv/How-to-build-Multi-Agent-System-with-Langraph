# Building Advanced Conversational Agents Using Langgraph: A Comprehensive Guide

**Introduction**

In the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP), conversational agents have become an integral part of various applications, from chatbots to virtual assistants. To build such advanced conversational agents, we need a robust framework that can handle complex dialogue management and multi-agent interactions. This is where Langgraph comes into play. Langgraph is a cutting-edge deep learning framework specifically designed for NLP applications, enabling developers to construct intricate Multi Agent Systems (MAS) with ease and efficiency. In this guide, we will delve into the world of Langgraph, exploring its features, setup, and best practices for building custom agents and optimizing performance.

**Introduction to Langgraph**

Langgraph is a Python-based framework that leverages the power of graph neural networks to model complex relationships between agents and their environments. This framework is built on top of the LangChain ecosystem, providing a seamless integration with other NLP tools and libraries.

**Framework Overview**

Langgraph's architecture is designed to handle large-scale conversational datasets, making it an ideal choice for building advanced conversational agents. The framework consists of three primary components:

1. **Graph Construction**: Langgraph allows developers to create complex graphs that represent the relationships between agents, users, and environments.
2. **Agent Modeling**: The framework provides a range of prebuils that can be customizet specific application requirements.
3. **Dialogue Management**: Langgraph's dialogue management system enables agents to engage in contextual conversations, taking into account the graph structure and agent interactions.

**Key Features**

Langgraph boasts several key features that set it apart from other NLP frameworks:

* **Superior Performance & Efficiency**: Langgraph's graph-based architecture enables faster processing and more efficient memory usage, making it suitable for large-scale applications.
* **Fully Integrated Into LangChain Ecosystem**: Langgraph is built on top of the LangChain ecosystem, providing seamless integration with other NLP tools and libraries.
* **Active Research & Development Project**: Langgraph is an actively maintained project, with a dedicated community contributing to its development and growth.



## Local Setup

If we are interested in testing this environment locally.

Let's assume you have Python installed.

## Step 1. Python Installation
First, you need to install Python  `3.11.9` if you haven't already. You can download the latest version from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). 

1. **Check Python Version:**
   - In the Command Prompt, type the following command to verify that Python is correctly added to the PATH:
```bash
python --version
```


You should see an output similar to:

```bash
Python 3.10.11
```
if you have another version but you installed it
just you can type the path where you have installed python e.g.
```bash
C:\Python310\python.exe --version
```
and should be work
```bash
Python 3.10.11
```


### Step 2: Create and Activate Virtual Environment

The environment we will consider is Python 3.10 We will create a virtual environment called `.venv`, but you can name it whatever you like.

In your terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to create your project and run:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Then, activate the virtual environment:

- **On Windows:**

```bash
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
```

- **On macOS and Linux:**

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Once the virtual environment is activated, you should see `(.venv)` preceding your terminal prompt. Now, upgrade `pip` and install the necessary packages:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

Next, install Elyra:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, create a new IPython kernel:

```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name langraph --display-name "Python 3.10 (Langraph)"
```
If you have something like this

To start Jupyter Lab, run:

```bash
jupyter lab
```
